## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-07

Correctness and security fixes. **Not compatible with v0.1.0 keys or
ciphertexts for MCFE-DDH and the DDH threshold schemes.** Several multi-client
schemes still have known privacy issues — read
[Known Issues / Security Notice](README.md#known-issues--security-notice)
before using them.

### Security

- **MCFE-DDH** (`pyfe4ai.MCFE`) re-implemented following CDGPP18: the label is
  hashed to a vector of group elements (SHAKE-256 into the quadratic-residue
  subgroup), every client slot has an independent key, and the functional key
  is the aggregate `d = Σ y_i · s_i`. Previously the label entered as a public
  MD5 scalar and keys carried per-client components, so a functional-key holder
  could recover an individual client's plaintexts.
- MCFE-DDH ndarray helpers derive a distinct label per element, so equal-label
  ciphertexts no longer leak differences between elements.
- **MIFE-DDH**: every input slot now has its own IPFE master key; previously all
  clients shared `w` / `g_a` and one client could unmask another's ciphertext.
- **DDH threshold** (tMIFE-DDH, tMCFE-DDH): Shamir share points start at 1 and
  sharing is done over the group order (point 0 used to be the secret itself,
  so server `sid_0` alone could decrypt); share and combine require at least
  `t` shares from the enrolled set, reject duplicate or unknown partial
  decryptions, and validate `1 ≤ t ≤ s`.
- Discrete-log tables for integer groups are built in memory and no longer
  loaded from disk (the pickle-based cache in the working directory could run
  arbitrary code).
- LWE-family label scalars never map to 0 (about 10% of labels used to remove
  the mask entirely). The structural leakage of LWE label masking remains; see
  Known Issues.

### Fixed

- MCFE-DDH decryption for `eta ≥ 2` (returned `None`).
- DDH threshold Lagrange coefficients are computed modulo the group order
  instead of with float division and truncation (subsets without `sid_0`
  failed); `setup` no longer raises `IndexError` and combining no longer
  hard-codes divisors for `eta ≥ 2`.
- `get_decryption_keys` of the five decentralized MCFE schemes raises
  `NotImplementedError` instead of returning the exception class; the ML
  adapter reports unsupported threshold/decentralized variants clearly.
- Pairing and quadratic test modules skip cleanly when `charm-crypto` is not
  installed.

### Changed (breaking)

- MCFE-DDH formats: `sk = {"s"}`, `dk = {"d": [d0, d1]}`, `ct = {"c"}`.
- MCFE-DDH ndarray helpers use per-element derived labels.
- Threshold `L()` takes a `modulus` argument; partial decryptions carry `sid`
  and `lst_sid_enrolled`, which `combine_decrypt` validates.

### Added

- `benchmarks/fl_path_coverage.py`: enumerates federated-learning path support
  over all 39 registry entries (`--output json` available).
- Regression tests for `eta ≥ 2`, `t < s` subsets that exclude `sid_0`,
  single-server rejection, duplicate shares, independent client keys, label
  binding, and the dlog cache.
- README *Known Issues / Security Notice*.

### Documentation

- `sec_param` is documented as a modulus bit length, not a security level.
- README bibliography: TAPFed DOI, venues for Gay20, DOT18 and the Ring-LWE
  construction, complete list of pairing-dependent modules.
- Landing page aligned with the Known Issues.
